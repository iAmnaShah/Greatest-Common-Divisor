# Greatest-Common-Divisor
5:The greatest common divisor of integers x and y is the largest integer that divides both x and y. Write a recursive function GCD that returns the greatest common divisor of x and y. The GDC of x and y is defined as follows: If y is equal to zero, then GDC(x, y) is x; otherwise GDC(x, y) is GDC(y, x % y) where % is the remainder operator.
